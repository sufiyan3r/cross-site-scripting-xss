    <h2>Causes and Solutions of Reflected XSS Vulnerability</h2>
    <p>The causes of Reflected XSS vulnerability are typically related to improper handling of user input in web applications. This can occur when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User input is not validated or sanitised properly</li>
      <li>User input is included in a web page without proper encoding or escaping</li>
      <li>User input is reflected back to the user without any validation or sanitization</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>To prevent Reflected XSS vulnerability, web developers can take several steps, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validating and sanitising user input</li>
      <li>Properly encoding or escaping user input before including it in a web page</li>
      <li>Using security mechanisms such as Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of executable scripts [1]</li>
      <li>Implementing secure coding practices and following security guidelines [3]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking these steps, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of Reflected XSS vulnerability in their web applications.</p>
